# Full Credit goes to Sai Vignesh Golla
## My contributions:
- I have bundled necessary chrome and chrome driver dependencies and changed code accordingly.
- As chrome removed automating stable chrome release, we must perform different steps to achieve the same with chrome.
- As i was using this application i faced issue with incompatible chrome version and chrome driver version.
- To make it easier, i have bundled those dependencies and altered the code to work in conundrum with them.
- One can just clone the repo, make changes and run without any issues with chrome automation.
- I have removed undetected_chromedriver usage. And this does not conflict with chrome you have already installed. Instead it runs chrome for tesing sandboxed application.
- Also had hiccup with creating logs folder, therefore i have bundled it as well, instead of writing code to create it.
