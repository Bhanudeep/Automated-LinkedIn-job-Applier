About the job
Software Engineer (Backend)

Location: Bangalore

Reporting Line: Head of Engineering

 At WeRize we are building India’s largest financial services brand for the 500 Mn lower middle-income customers in 4000+ small cities (which we call “India 4”). This customer segment has very little penetration of formal loans, insurance or saving products as existing financial service players see this segment as risky and non-profitable. We have created custom lending, insurance and saving products that are tailor-made to serve the needs of India-4 customers.
 To reach these customers at low CAC, we have built a proprietary tech enabled offlineto-online social distribution channel where we have onboarded thousands of financially literate free-lancers such as LIC agents and junior financial sector employees in 1000+ cities. Our fully automated social partner app is available in 6 Indian languages and helps us manage these partners remotely without any physical presence.
 The general perception is that this customer segment is highly risky and non-lendable. We are happy to share that we have been able to maintain near 0% default rates despite Covid19 . Our proprietary ML based family underwriting where we evaluate the P&L of the family and give a joint liability family loan has helped us maintain these low default rates.
 We have achieved Operational profitability and are on-track to reach EBITDA+ by end of 2021

About the job
Job Description 

Telus International AI Data Solutions or TI AI for short, has been a global leader in data services since 2005. Listed on Feb 21 on the NYSE, TI now has a market cap of $10Million+. With Playment’s acquisition on July 21, we now have a combined strength in video, images, and audio text labelling, serving the world’s top ML teams. We’ve built a truly industry-agnostic platform to support the growing needs of our customers.

High-quality training data is quintessential to improve the precision of ML algorithms. Forbes lists ‘Autonomous Cars’ as one of the technology trends for the next decade and also estimates ML engineers spend 70% of their time in pre/post-processing & data management steps. Companies need to build sophisticated tooling (supporting all forms of sensor data) ,and hire and manage hundreds of skilled people to ensure high-quality labelled data. Our autonomous driving customers estimate that 1 hour of video data needs 800 man-hours of manual human work. Today, in the wake of the autonomous car industry only a few million km of data has been labelled, and 10x more will be collected before the world sees them on the road.

We aim to become an AI data platform, a critical part of the AI infrastructure stack.

● Drive product and design discussions 
● Elevate the skills of the team through technical mentorship

Requirements : 
● Strong problem-solving skills 
● At least 2+ years of experience working in a product company 
● Good knowledge of data structures and algorithms 
● Fast learner 
● Proficient in at least one programming language like Java, C# or Golang. 
● Experience working with different kinds of data stores - key-value, relational, NoSQL, etc and queuing systems 
● Good grasp of fundamentals of computer science and web development 
● Has extensive experience contributing to the architecture and design of distributed systems ● Able to give and receive constructive feedback

Benefits : 
● Work with a world-class team working on a very forward-looking problem.

About the job
Software Engineer (Backend)

Location: Bangalore

Reporting Line: Head of Engineering

 At WeRize we are building India’s largest financial services brand for the 500 Mn lower middle-income customers in 4000+ small cities (which we call “India 4”). This customer segment has very little penetration of formal loans, insurance or saving products as existing financial service players see this segment as risky and non-profitable. We have created custom lending, insurance and saving products that are tailor-made to serve the needs of India-4 customers.
 To reach these customers at low CAC, we have built a proprietary tech enabled offlineto-online social distribution channel where we have onboarded thousands of financially literate free-lancers such as LIC agents and junior financial sector employees in 1000+ cities. Our fully automated social partner app is available in 6 Indian languages and helps us manage these partners remotely without any physical presence.
 The general perception is that this customer segment is highly risky and non-lendable. We are happy to share that we have been able to maintain near 0% default rates despite Covid19 . Our proprietary ML based family underwriting where we evaluate the P&L of the family and give a joint liability family loan has helped us maintain these low default rates.
 We have achieved Operational profitability and are on-track to reach EBITDA+ by end of 2021

Fund Raise Funds Raised: $10.25 million

Stage: Series A

Investors

 Kalaari Capital (Indian VC with $850MN AUM and investments such as Myntra, CureFit, Dream11, ElasticRun)

About the job
Software Engineer (Backend)

Location: Bangalore

Reporting Line: Head of Engineering

 At WeRize we are building India’s largest financial services brand for the 500 Mn lower middle-income customers in 4000+ small cities (which we call “India 4”). This customer segment has very little penetration of formal loans, insurance or saving products as existing financial service players see this segment as risky and non-profitable. We have created custom lending, insurance and saving products that are tailor-made to serve the needs of India-4 customers.
 To reach these customers at low CAC, we have built a proprietary tech enabled offlineto-online social distribution channel where we have onboarded thousands of financially literate free-lancers such as LIC agents and junior financial sector employees in 1000+ cities. Our fully automated social partner app is available in 6 Indian languages and helps us manage these partners remotely without any physical presence.
 The general perception is that this customer segment is highly risky and non-lendable. We are happy to share that we have been able to maintain near 0% default rates despite Covid19 . Our proprietary ML based family underwriting where we evaluate the P&L of the family and give a joint liability family loan has helped us maintain these low default rates.
 We have achieved Operational profitability and are on-track to reach EBITDA+ by end of 2021

Fund Raise Funds Raised: $10.25 million

About the job
Job Description 

Telus International AI Data Solutions or TI AI for short, has been a global leader in data services since 2005. Listed on Feb 21 on the NYSE, TI now has a market cap of $10Million+. With Playment’s acquisition on July 21, we now have a combined strength in video, images, and audio text labelling, serving the world’s top ML teams. We’ve built a truly industry-agnostic platform to support the growing needs of our customers. Eg of our customer use cases - Automotive companies build self-driving capabilities, Agriculture companies for identify weeds & fruit picking, Insurance companies for claim processing & damage detection, Retail companies for shelf tracking, Drone/Satellite imagery for terrain analysis, E-commerce for cataloguing & visual object understanding etc.

Why is it important?

High-quality training data is quintessential to improve the precision of ML algorithms. Forbes lists ‘Autonomous Cars’ as one of the technology trends for the next decade and also estimates ML engineers spend 70% of their time in pre/post-processing & data management steps. Companies need to build sophisticated tooling (supporting all forms of sensor data) ,and hire and manage hundreds of skilled people to ensure high-quality labelled data. Our autonomous driving customers estimate that 1 hour of video data needs 800 man-hours of manual human work. Today, in the wake of the autonomous car industry only a few million km of data has been labelled, and 10x more will be collected before the world sees them on the road. Just as DevOps is critical to tech implementation, AI Ops will be a big challenge as AI development commercialises in the next 5-10 years. We aim to become an AI data platform, a critical part of the AI infrastructure stack.

Responsibilities : 
● Build services and platforms which power TI AI 
● Understand, follow and contribute to TI AI's standards for the software development life cycle ● Work closely with the product and tech team to deliver efficient, maintainable and unit tested software 
● Collaborate with product & business teams to understand customer journeys and solve problems that help TI AI grow. 
● Lead architecture and design of new and old systems 
● Drive product and design discussions 
● Elevate the skills of the team through technical mentorship

Requirements : 
● Strong problem-solving skills 
● At least 2+ years of experience working in a product company 
● Good knowledge of data structures and algorithms 
● Fast learner 
● Proficient in at least one programming language like Java, C# or Golang. 
● Experience working with different kinds of data stores - key-value, relational, NoSQL, etc and queuing systems 
● Good grasp of fundamentals of computer science and web development 
● Has extensive experience contributing to the architecture and design of distributed systems ● Able to give and receive constructive feedback

Benefits : 
● Work with a world-class team working on a very forward-looking problem.
● Competitive Pay
● Health insurance for the family
● Open Culture
● Work accessories and a great work location
● Flexible Timings

About the job
Location: Noida

The "Internet of Things" (IoT) is expected to grow to $19 trillion over the next 10 years as 50 billion devices are brought online. Aeris is at the forefront of this industry, building networks and applications to enable Fortune 500 clients like Chrysler, Honda and Bosch fundamentally improve their businesses. Headquartered in Silicon Valley with offices in Chicago, London, Delhi, and Tokyo. We rank among the top ten cellular providers for the IoT globally, powering critical projects across energy, transportation, retail, healthcare and more.

Our company is in an enviable spot. We’re profitable, and both our bottom line and our global reach are growing rapidly. We’re playing in an exploding market where technology evolves daily and new IoT / M2M solutions and platforms are being created at a fast-pace.

Our development teams collectively have over 100+ patents, offering our employees access to some of the most brilliant minds in the industry, providing continuous growth opportunities– in an environment that values innovation, autonomy and integrity.

We put our customers first. When making decisions, we always seek to do what is right for our customer first, our company second, our teams third, and individual selves last
We do things differently. As a pioneer in a highly-competitive industry that is poised to reshape every sector of the global economy, we cannot fall back on old models. Rather, we must chart our own path and strive to out-innovate, out-learn, out-maneuver and out-pace the competition on the way
We walk the walk on diversity. We are a brilliant and eclectic mix of ethnicities, religions, industry experiences, sexual orientations, generations and more – and that is by design. We see diverse perspectives as a core competitive advantage
Integrity is essential. We believe in doing things well – and doing them right. Integrity is a core value here: you’ll see it embodied in our staff, our management approach and growing social impact work (we have a VP devoted to it). You’ll also see it exhibited in the way we lead our people and how we handle our HR issues: we expect employees and managers to deal with issues directly, immediately and with the utmost respect for each other and for the Company
We are owners. Strong managers enable and empower their teams to figure out how to solve problems. You will be no exception. As a part of Aeris you will have the ownership, accountability and autonomy needed to be truly creative

Our Aeris Noida office is based in the heart of the Noida IT Hub in Sec 62. We have a state-of-the-art collaborative workspace with open desks, recreation space, a round-the-clock fully stocked cafeteria and a terrace garden - to name just a few of our perks. We also have one of the best health and insurance benefit schemes in the industry to ensure that our employees and their family are taken care of.

As Aeris continues to grow, we are looking for a full stack Software Developer. That's where you come in! You will be working with our Software Architect Working Group & Labs team getting numerous opportunities to work on the latest and upcoming technology stacks, and deploying to public (GCP) and private cloud environments. This is an opportunity to advance your career, be involved in selecting the Aeris technology stacks, and implementing fast-paced proof of concepts that will eventually make significant contributions to the organization. As an additional responsibility, you may be asked to support existing product teams for critical pieces of their deliveries.

Essential Duties And Responsibilities

Work with the Software Architecture Working Group (SAWG) on cross-product technology and architecture problems
Evaluate new technology stacks and architecture patterns via performance tests
Create technical documents including design documents, architecture documents, and performance test reports
Present your work to the wider engineering team at Aeris

5+ years of development experience
Bachelor’s or master’s Degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or equivalent discipline/experience
Proficiency in at least 2 modern programming languages (Java, Javascript, Python, Go, Rust etc)
Knowledge of computer science fundamentals, data structures, and algorithms
Excellent team player, creative, self-motivated, positive attitude with ability to work independently and with cross-functional teams to solve complex problems
Excellent communication skills (written and verbal)

About IMMO 
We are IMMO. Here to revolutionize the real estate industry, for consumers and investors alike. 
Residential real estate is the biggest asset class in the world and the market in Europe is worth an estimated $50 trillion. It’s a huge untapped market, but it’s also completely fragmented! 
Homeowners wrestle with huge fees and uncertain processes when they want to sell. Renters struggle to find high-quality homes and often deal with unsympathetic landlords. Financial institutions can’t invest large pools of money into the sector without hiring an army of disparate third parties. And to complicate matters further, building new homes churns out gigatons of carbon, all whilst we face a housing crisis and a global climate emergency. 
IMMO is Europe's first technology powered residential real estate platform, designed to create portfolios of existing single family rental (SFR) and multifamily housing (MFH). 

Our proprietary technology allows us to unlock investment access to 98% of the residential market currently being overlooked, at scale and speed. At the same time, we offer better solutions to consumers – empowering homeowners with quick and transparent sales, and providing a next-gen renting experience for our residents to enjoy living in beautiful homes. With technology in our DNA, data is at the heart of decision making, and we do things sustainably by up-cycling existing properties that are responsibly retrofitted. 
Among our investors are some of the world’s top venture capital firms. IMMO has been awarded “Tech Pioneer” by the World Economic Forum and has been titled “Real estate asset manager of the future” by Goldman Sachs. 
We are 170+ strong with experienced professionals working across our integrated residential ‘value chain’: sourcing and acquisitions, refurbishment, lettings, property management and portfolio management. Our team includes successful entrepreneurs and industry leaders from WeWork, Goldman Sachs, Roundhill, Morgan Stanley, Barclay, Google and many others – and we are growing, fast. With a strong track record in some of the toughest European residential markets, we’re now eyeing expansion across the continent, building up our presence in Germany, Spain and the UK. 
We’re straightforward, open-minded, creative and not afraid to challenge the status quo. And we’re looking for talented IMMOrtals to join us in our mission to truly change the way consumers and investors access residential real estate.

About the job
About Bijak
Bijak is India’s No.1 Agritrading app and a pioneer in the field of agritech. Founded in April 2019, Bijak has been scaling up exponentially by creating user-friendly digital solutions for Indian agri traders. Today, our app is used in 1000 regions in 27 Indian states and UTs, and has over 50,000 registered users. The platform oversees trade in 100+ commodities every day and now sees an annualized GMV of Rs 4000 crores.
The Indian agricultural sector is estimated to be worth $300 Bn and generates employment for over 40% of the Indian population. However, the processes and agri trading practices in this sector have remained unchanged for decades. Over the past few years, we have designed digital solutions that help agri traders tackle challenges at key points in their trading journey. 
Bijak users are majorly composed of B2B traders who control 80% of this $300 Bn agri value chain. They have limited access to technology, information, and credit. Bijak helps these users - buyers, suppliers, MSMEs, corporate buyers - discover verified counterparties and trade with minimal friction by accessing Bijak’s layer of trust and reliability. 
Our success lies in understanding our users and creating solutions that mirror their trading process, while solving major pain points along the way. Be it lack of transparency, inadequate access to working capital, reliable counterparty discovery or logistics, there is a Bijak feature that addresses it.

Trying to Apply to "Backend Developer | CRED" job. Job ID: 3861556491
HR info was not given for "Backend Developer" with Job ID: 3861556491!
Skipping this job.
Experience required 6 > Current Experience 3
About the job
what is CRED?
CRED is an exclusive community for India’s most trustworthy and creditworthy individuals, where the members are rewarded for good financial behavior. CRED was born out of a need to bring back the focus on a long lost virtue, one of trust, the idea being to create a community centered around this virtue. a community that constantly strives to become more virtuous in this regard till they finally scale their behavior to create a utopia where being trustworthy is the norm and not the exception. to build a community like this requires a community of its own; a community special in its own way, working towards making this vision come true.

here’s a thought experiment: what do you get when you put a group of incredibly passionate and driven people and entrust them with the complete freedom to chase down their goals in a completely uninhibited manner? answer: you get something close to what we have at CRED; CRED just has it better.

here’s what will be in store for you at CRED once you join as a part of the customer success team

what will you do:
you will work on a disruptive product that’s still in its early stages
you will be responsible to drive innovation in software development, while relentlessly improving performance, scalability, and maintainability.
you will own the design process, implementation, and verification of framework components leveraging standard software engineering methodologies
you will be translating functional and technical requirements into detailed architecture and design.
you will be responsible for mentoring other engineers, defining our technical culture, and helping to build a fast-growing team.

you should apply if you:
someone having 6-8 years of experience in product development, architecture, and design
constantly learning and looking for ways to improve yourself and the processes around you
mentoring and supporting other team members by doing code reviews and applying your experience in process and technical leadership
working in an agile team environment and are a self-starter, conscientious member of the team
passionate to code, but also you’re awesome at it!
interested in working with Java/Golang programming languages, have proficiency in DDB, RDS, Aerospike databases, and possess experience with the AWS cloud platform

how is life at CRED?
working at CRED would instantly make you realize one thing: you are working with the best talent around you. not just in the role you occupy, but everywhere you go. talk to someone around you; most likely you will be talking to a singer, standup comic, artist, writer, an athlete, maybe a magician. at CRED people always have talent up their sleeves. with the right company, even conversations can be rejuvenating. at CRED, we guarantee a good company.

hard truths: pushing oneself comes with the role. and we realise pushing oneself is hard work. which is why CRED is in the continuous process of building an environment that helps the team rejuvenate oneself: included but not limited to a stacked, in-house pantry, with lunch and dinner provided for all the team members, paid sick leaves and a comprehensive health insurance.

to make things smoother and to make sure you spend time and energy only on the most important things, CRED strives to make every process transparent: there are no work timings because we do not believe in archaic methods of calculating productivity, your work should speak for you. there are no job designations because you will be expected to hold down roles that cannot be described in one word.

there are many more such eccentricities that make CRED what it is but that’s for one to discover. if you feel at home reading this, get in touch

About the job
Job Description 

Telus International AI Data Solutions or TI AI for short, has been a global leader in data services since 2005. Listed on Feb 21 on the NYSE, TI now has a market cap of $10Million+. With Playment’s acquisition on July 21, we now have a combined strength in video, images, and audio text labelling, serving the world’s top ML teams. We’ve built a truly industry-agnostic platform to support the growing needs of our customers. Eg of our customer use cases - Automotive companies build self-driving capabilities, Agriculture companies for identify weeds & fruit picking, Insurance companies for claim processing & damage detection, Retail companies for shelf tracking, Drone/Satellite imagery for terrain analysis, E-commerce for cataloguing & visual object understanding etc.

Why is it important?

High-quality training data is quintessential to improve the precision of ML algorithms. Forbes lists ‘Autonomous Cars’ as one of the technology trends for the next decade and also estimates ML engineers spend 70% of their time in pre/post-processing & data management steps. Companies need to build sophisticated tooling (supporting all forms of sensor data) ,and hire and manage hundreds of skilled people to ensure high-quality labelled data. Our autonomous driving customers estimate that 1 hour of video data needs 800 man-hours of manual human work. Today, in the wake of the autonomous car industry only a few million km of data has been labelled, and 10x more will be collected before the world sees them on the road. Just as DevOps is critical to tech implementation, AI Ops will be a big challenge as AI development commercialises in the next 5-10 years. We aim to become an AI data platform, a critical part of the AI infrastructure stack.

Responsibilities : 
● Build services and platforms which power TI AI 
● Understand, follow and contribute to TI AI's standards for the software development life cycle ● Work closely with the product and tech team to deliver efficient, maintainable and unit tested software 
● Collaborate with product & business teams to understand customer journeys and solve problems that help TI AI grow. 
● Lead architecture and design of new and old systems 
● Drive product and design discussions 
● Elevate the skills of the team through technical mentorship

Requirements : 
● Strong problem-solving skills 
● At least 2+ years of experience working in a product company 
● Good knowledge of data structures and algorithms 
● Fast learner 
● Proficient in at least one programming language like Java, C# or Golang. 
● Experience working with different kinds of data stores - key-value, relational, NoSQL, etc and queuing systems 
● Good grasp of fundamentals of computer science and web development 
● Has extensive experience contributing to the architecture and design of distributed systems ● Able to give and receive constructive feedback

Benefits : 
● Work with a world-class team working on a very forward-looking problem.
● Competitive Pay
● Health insurance for the family
● Open Culture
● Work accessories and a great work location
● Flexible Timings

About IMMO 
We are IMMO. Here to revolutionize the real estate industry, for consumers and investors alike. 
Residential real estate is the biggest asset class in the world and the market in Europe is worth an estimated $50 trillion. It’s a huge untapped market, but it’s also completely fragmented! 
Homeowners wrestle with huge fees and uncertain processes when they want to sell. Renters struggle to find high-quality homes and often deal with unsympathetic landlords. Financial institutions can’t invest large pools of money into the sector without hiring an army of disparate third parties. And to complicate matters further, building new homes churns out gigatons of carbon, all whilst we face a housing crisis and a global climate emergency. 
IMMO is Europe's first technology powered residential real estate platform, designed to create portfolios of existing single family rental (SFR) and multifamily housing (MFH). 

Our proprietary technology allows us to unlock investment access to 98% of the residential market currently being overlooked, at scale and speed. At the same time, we offer better solutions to consumers – empowering homeowners with quick and transparent sales, and providing a next-gen renting experience for our residents to enjoy living in beautiful homes. With technology in our DNA, data is at the heart of decision making, and we do things sustainably by up-cycling existing properties that are responsibly retrofitted. 
Among our investors are some of the world’s top venture capital firms. IMMO has been awarded “Tech Pioneer” by the World Economic Forum and has been titled “Real estate asset manager of the future” by Goldman Sachs. 
We are 170+ strong with experienced professionals working across our integrated residential ‘value chain’: sourcing and acquisitions, refurbishment, lettings, property management and portfolio management. Our team includes successful entrepreneurs and industry leaders from WeWork, Goldman Sachs, Roundhill, Morgan Stanley, Barclay, Google and many others – and we are growing, fast. With a strong track record in some of the toughest European residential markets, we’re now eyeing expansion across the continent, building up our presence in Germany, Spain and the UK. 
We’re straightforward, open-minded, creative and not afraid to challenge the status quo. And we’re looking for talented IMMOrtals to join us in our mission to truly change the way consumers and investors access residential real estate.

Job Description

Job Summary:

As a Software Development Engineer 3 you are in a senior Individual Contributor engineering role at Tesco. Your proficiency with foundational computer science and software engineering concepts is taken as a given; and you will have proven significant technical depth and breadth. At this level you will be playing an active role in technical leadership; with proven impact across teams and the wider directorate. You take ownership and accountability of the development of the products in your domain. You participate in activities that build capability across the organisation: coaching and mentoring of existing colleagues; and interviewing/hiring of new colleagues. Once you have reached the SDE3 level; progression will vary significantly; and is likely to include more lateral opportunities than vertical promotion. This is also the level of core technical knowledge you must reach before considering a sideways move to the management track.

In this job; I am accountable for:

My impact reaches beyond my immediate team; and I provide perspective and context for technology choices across my directorate. The work that I do has foundational impact across teams in my area and the directorate that I am a member of. I am a technical leader for my teams and others will regularly come to me for mentorship and support. I am comfortable both supporting other engineers in their delivery and taking the lead on key features as appropriate. I have delivered multiple projects that move the needle for the business. I have demonstrated technical breadth and depth; I am an expert in my domain.

At this level I display a high degree of ownership for the work conducted by the team. I am accountable for the quality of every result; produced by individuals and teams. I am an advocate of best practices across my directorate. I build maturity in the way we develop; deliver and operate services. I ensure that we’re learning from the best in the industry; designing and implementing appropriate testing and deployment strategies.

I can anticipate feature evolution of my product. I utilise this when facilitating design sessions to ensure that the system architecture evolves to support future requirements. I understand the wider Tesco architectural strategy and champion its application to the systems that I work on. At this level my job starts to become just as much about exercising technical judgment as it does about implementation.

I am comfortable managing competing priorities and am able to bring order to ambiguous scenarios. I create optimal outcomes combining short-term and long-term goals; utilising data driven decision making techniques to take appropriate trade-offs. I can identify risks and proactively engage with product and programme managers. I am a strong communicator within my team and to my stakeholders.

I am a trusted mentor; a role-model for more junior engineers. I am approachable and am frequently asked to mentor those around me. I prioritise sharing skills and technical knowledge across the directorate; both informally in 1:1 discussions and by arranging more formal training opportunities.

I build capability and raise the bar by contributing to hiring and interviewing practices. I regularly participate in recruitment assessments. Externally I represent the best of Tesco Technology to attract new talent and encourage interest in our organisation.
